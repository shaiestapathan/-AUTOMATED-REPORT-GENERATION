DESCRIPTION:
This project is part of Task 2 in the CodTech Python Internship, which focuses on automated report generation using Python. The goal of this task is to develop a Python script that reads and analyzes student data, performs basic calculations, visualizes the results, and generates a professional PDF report using libraries like FPDF and Matplotlib.

ðŸ“Œ Objective
The main objective was to create a report system that:
Reads structured data about students' scores
Calculates useful statistics like average scores and top performers
Generates clean, informative visualizations
Compiles everything into a nicely formatted PDF document
This approach helps in converting raw academic data into a useful and visually appealing report that can be shared with schools, teachers, or parents.

ðŸ§® Data Processing
We created a sample dataset consisting of 15 students, each having marks in three subjects: Math, Science, and English. Each student also had a total score, calculated by summing their subject marks.
The script performs the following operations:
Calculates the average score for each subject
Identifies the top scorer
Sorts students by their total marks to assign ranks
Organizes the data into a structured format for display

ðŸ“Š Data Visualization
To make the data easier to understand, a line chart is generated using Matplotlib. This chart plots each studentâ€™s performance across the three subjects. We used markers, gridlines, and customized legends to improve readability.
The chart shows trends and comparisons between students
It includes labels, titles, and a color-coded legend outside the plot
The chart is saved as an image and embedded in the PDF

ðŸ“„ PDF Report Structure
The report is generated using FPDF, and it contains three pages:
Title Page
Includes school name, report title, academic year, and a motivational quote
Uses stylish fonts, centered alignment, and a soft green background
Adds a timestamp for report generation
Summary & Table Page
Starts with a summary showing total number of students and the top scorer
Displays subject-wise average scores
Contains a well-formatted table listing each studentâ€™s marks, total score, and rank
Uses alternating row colors for better readability
Chart & Final Summary Page
Shows the line chart of student marks
Displays a table with subject-wise averages again
Ends with a brief report summary paragraph describing the analysis

âœ… Key Learnings and Skills Applied
Used FPDF to create professional PDFs with text, shapes, and images
Used Matplotlib for generating visual graphs dynamically
Learned how to format tables and design multi-page documents with headers, fills, and layout control
Practiced data processing, sorting, and statistical calculations in Python
Understood how to build a complete end-to-end solution that reads data, analyzes it, visualizes it, and exports it as a shareable document

This task enhanced practical knowledge in automated report generation, a useful skill in fields like education, HR, finance, and data analysis. It showed how Python can be used to turn raw data into meaningful reports that are both informative and presentable.
